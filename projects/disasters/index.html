          In 2012, an estimated 32.4 million people 
          in 82 countries were newly displaced by 
          disasters.
        </h1>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <p>
            Over five years from 2008 to 2012, 
            around 144 million people were forced from their homes in 
            125 countries. Around three-quarters of these countries 
            were affected by multiple disaster-induced displacement 
            events over the period.

        <div class="col-1-2">

            Repeated displacement sets back 
            recovery and development gains, undermines resilience 
            and compounds vulnerability to further disaster.
            Data reveals strong patterns of frequent and
            repeated displacement as well as 
            displacement on a massive scale.

          The vast majority of displacement is 
          triggered by climate and weather-related 
          hazards.
        </h1>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <p>
            Most of this displacement was triggered by floods and 
            storms. Other climate and weather-related hazards that
            caused significant amounts of displacement include wet 
            landslides, extreme cold and wildfires.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-1-2">
          <p>
            In the situation of a rapid-onset hazard, such as a flood, 
            storm, earthquake or wildfire, the damage and destruction 
            of housing is a direct cause of displacement as homes 
            are rendered uninhabitable and people are forced to 
            seek shelter and safety elsewhere.

          The two largest events of 2012, flood disasters in north-
          east India and Nigeria, accounted for 41% of 
          the yearâ€™s total.
        </h1>
        <div class="col-1-2">

            Eight disasters each caused mass displacement
            on the largest scale of between one to 6.9 
            million people. The varying frequency and size of such 
            mega-scale events has created substantial fluctuations 
            in global totals for each year.

            Annual global displacement 
            between 2008 and 2012 has ranged between 16.5 million 
            people in 2011 and over 42.3 million in 2010.
            While prolonged and protracted displacement is not uncommon, 
            particularly following major disasters, the cumulative
            number of displaced people worldwide as of the end 
            of 2012 is unknown.

          The systematic collection, analysis and

            The <a target="blank" href="http://www.internal-displacement.org/">
            Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre</a> 
            (IDMC) is a world leader in the monitoring and
            analysis of the causes, effects and responses
            to internal displacement. For the millions
            worldwide forced to flee within their own 
            country as a consequence of conflict, generalised
            violence, ralised violence, human rights violations, and 
            natural hazards, IDMC advocates for better 
            responses to internally displaced people, while 
            promoting respect for their human rights.

            IDMC regularly reviews various types of information
            released by different sources on the numbers, needs and 
            characteristics of displaced households and individuals, 
            either as primary data gathered from displaced household
            or from secondary data compiled from various other 
            sources. IDMC is part of the Norwegian Refugee
            Council (<a target="blank" href="http://www.nrc.no/">NRC</a>).
